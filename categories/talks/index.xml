      <description>A self-hosted, NixOS-powered homelab running a lightweight Kubernetes cluster via k3s, complete with monitoring and dashboards; all declaratively managed and exposed via local DNS.
I&amp;rsquo;ve shared this setup within my close circle and hobby clubs. Figured out it’s time to put it out here too.

      <title>Blinking LEDs: For the Brave and Curious</title>

      <description>Some years ago, boredom struck the night before an exam (cue gif: “I know this one, this is classic”). I decided to flash the Arduino blink sketch, but without the Arduino IDE, or even Arduino functions. Just raw C. What started as a dumb idea spiraled into a decent rabbit hole, which somehow became a flash talk I gave at a few places. Eventually bundled it all into a repo during Kochi FOSS meetup.</description>
