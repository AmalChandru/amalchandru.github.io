      <title>How Containers Actually Work: Building Container Networking From Scratch</title>
      <link>https://amalchandran.xyz/journals/building-container-networking-from-scratch-part-1/</link>

      <description>Containers often feel like magic, and container networking can seem like a higher form of black magic. A process starts, gets its own IP address, can reach the internet, and talks to other containers. All without us touching low-level networking.
But nothing magical is happening.
Under the hood, container networking is built from a small set of Linux primitives: network namespaces, virtual Ethernet devices (veth), routing tables and NAT. In this write-up, we&amp;rsquo;ll build that setup manually to see exactly what Docker and other container runtimes are doing on our behalf.</description>

      <title>neozorba@nixlab - A highly opinionated, minimalist, declarative Kubernetes homelab</title>

      <description>A self-hosted, NixOS-powered homelab running a lightweight Kubernetes cluster via k3s, complete with monitoring and dashboards; all declaratively managed and exposed via local DNS.
I&amp;rsquo;ve shared this setup within my close circle and hobby clubs. Figured out it’s time to put it out here too.

      <title>Blinking LEDs: For the Brave and Curious</title>

      <description>Some years ago, boredom struck the night before an exam (cue gif: “I know this one, this is classic”). I decided to flash the Arduino blink sketch, but without the Arduino IDE, or even Arduino functions. Just raw C. What started as a dumb idea spiraled into a decent rabbit hole, which somehow became a flash talk I gave at a few places. Eventually bundled it all into a repo during Kochi FOSS meetup.</description>

      <title>The Caged Song</title>

      <description>I used to believe that creativity thrived in absolute freedom.
But over time, I wondered, do limits hold it back, or do they give it shape?
A bird in flight may roam the skies,
Yet sings no tune, just silent sighs.
But cage the wings, confine its space,
A melody will fill the place.
For freedom vast may lose its way,
While boundaries teach the notes to play.
Not every wall is built to bind,</description>

      <description>2024 was a busy year. I shifted two houses this year, visited four places on my travel list, completed two half marathons, and went on a long bike trip of 650+ kilometers. I also found myself in some tough conversations and situations.
Here are some lessons I learned this year. Some are common sense, but I’ve included them because I tend to overlook the obvious. Some are my own realizations, and others come from wise people I’ve met along the way:</description>

      <description>artist, engineer, tinkerer, absurdist .. I am Amal and this is my horcrux. I mostly write proprietary software for a living. I write open-source software for the joy of it.
During my free time, I love to read (self-help, romance, and thrillers are a big no; I stopped reading those long ago and really enjoy in-depth reads). I occasionally go for a run (I can complete half marathons in under 2 hours), swim (I’ve never tracked anything, but I enjoy the views both inside and above water.</description>
