      <title>How Containers Actually Work: Building Container Networking From Scratch</title>

      <description>Containers often feel like magic, and container networking can seem like a higher form of black magic. A process starts, gets its own IP address, can reach the internet, and talks to other containers. All without us touching low-level networking.
But nothing magical is happening.
Under the hood, container networking is built from a small set of Linux primitives: network namespaces, virtual Ethernet devices (veth), routing tables and NAT. In this write-up, we&amp;rsquo;ll build that setup manually to see exactly what Docker and other container runtimes are doing on our behalf.</description>

      <title>The Caged Song</title>

      <description>I used to believe that creativity thrived in absolute freedom.
But over time, I wondered, do limits hold it back, or do they give it shape?
A bird in flight may roam the skies,
Yet sings no tune, just silent sighs.
But cage the wings, confine its space,
A melody will fill the place.
For freedom vast may lose its way,
While boundaries teach the notes to play.
Not every wall is built to bind,</description>

      <description>2024 was a busy year. I shifted two houses this year, visited four places on my travel list, completed two half marathons, and went on a long bike trip of 650+ kilometers. I also found myself in some tough conversations and situations.
Here are some lessons I learned this year. Some are common sense, but I’ve included them because I tend to overlook the obvious. Some are my own realizations, and others come from wise people I’ve met along the way:</description>
